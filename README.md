# Context_Switching
This is a simple round-robin scheduler for the ARM Cortex-M0.

I am study multi-thread. I found Adam Heinrich tutorial 
https://www.adamheinrich.com/blog/2016/07/context-switch-on-the-arm-cortex-m0/

I am much obliged to Adam Heinrich for your example.
Because his example is coded in GCC and i don't know how to debug in with GDB.
It will be esier debugging with IAR.
=>  I ported this example to IAR for ARM (ver 8.0).


The example run on STM32F051R8 Discovery board.
Preconditon: library STM32F0-Discovery_FW_V1.0.0.
I include whole project which I created by IAR.

You can download my project as reference.

Well, It's time to enjoy ^^!
